Always a work in progress.

Approached task by using the templates given in sections and then put them together to make one structured page. Added new rows and columns for more information and resources as time went on. Made it my own by looking into something different in terms of CSS then what was provided in the original instructions. Will continue to update as I learn more and have more resources to add.
